            <p class="subtext">In the annals of history, tales of valor and heroism often center around noble knights adorned in shining armor, their deeds immortalized in the legends of old. Yet, amidst these tales, there exists one extraordinary figure whose story remains shrouded in mystery and intrigue—the enigmatic Sir Draconis, the Dragon Knight. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="subtext">Born of fire and steel, Sir Draconis defied the conventions of his time, striding boldly into battle atop a magnificent dragon, his bond with the mighty creature a testament to the unbreakable bond between man and beast. His exploits echoed through the ages, his name whispered in awe and reverence by those who dared to speak of him. </p>
